Lou's Birthday

うわぁ～～～～っ！\nここにあるおかし、ほんとうに好きなだけ選んでいいんですか！？=Uwaaah!!! Are you really sure I can pick as many treats as I want from this entire store?!
僕からのバースデープレゼントだよ！=Of course, it's my birthday present for you!
こんなとこ初めて来たですよ！\nまるで夢みたいで……あれ？　本当に夢かも？\nまぁ、こまかいことはどうでもいいですね！=It's the first time I've been to such a place! It's almost like I'm in a dream... Huh? Maybe I really am? Well, not that it really matters, does it!
えへへ、うれしいですぅ！\nん～と、え～っと……=Ehehe, I'm so happy! Umm, umm...
当たり付きガムに～、きなこ棒に～……あっ、ねりあめもあるですぅ！\nそれからこれと、これと……\nここの棚ぜ～んぶほしいですぅ！=There's some gum packs... kinako sticks... and even some candy paste! Also this and that... I want all the things on the shelves too!
……{playername}さん、ほんとうに大丈夫です？\n前おかし屋に行ったときは、\nお金ぜんぜん持ってないっていってたですよね？=...Are you really sure this is okay, {playername}-san? The last time we went to buy some candies, you said you didn't have any money on you, right?
この日のために準備してきた！=I've prepared for this day and saved up!
{playername}さん……！\nルゥのために、そこまでおこづかいを貯めて……！？={playername}-san...! Did you really save so much money for Lou...!?
そんなに祝ってくれるなんてかんげきですぅ！\nそういうことなら……店員のおばあさん！\nもっともっとおかしを持ってくるですぅ～！=To think you're throwing such a grand celebration for me... I'm so grateful! In that case... Granny! Bring out all the sweets you have!
ただ、他にも溜まったものがあって……=However, there's also a little something I saved up for today...
宿題の山を渡す。=*I reveal a mountain of homework*
ひいいっっ！？\nどうしてこんなものが……えっ？\nおこづかいは……ルゥをたくさん勉強させるかわりに、てにいれた……？=EEEEKKKKKKK!? Where did you even get such a thing...? Eh? The reason you got all that money for Lou... was under the promise you'd also make her study harder...?
なんですかその取引は～っ！？\nうぅ……ルゥはただ、おかしを一生ぶん食べたいだけなのに！\nこんな誕生日プレゼントはいらないですよぉ～っ！=What kind of trick deal even is that!? Ugh... Lou just wants to eat as many sweets as she can for the rest of her life! I don't need this other birthday present!
普段からコツコツ勉強しないから……=You're not exactly known for studying properly...
そういう話はいいんですぅ！\nはぁ……ほんとうにせちがらい世の中ですね……=Enough talk about that! *sigh* This really is a different world...
まぁ、宿題をどうするかはおかしを食べてから考えるとして……\n{playername}さんもおかしを食べるですぅ！\nこうなったら、一緒にかいけつさくを考えるですよ！=Well, I'll think something up about my homework later, after I'm done eating my sweets... which you're eating too, {playername}-san! Now that we've come this far together, let's also think of a way out!
