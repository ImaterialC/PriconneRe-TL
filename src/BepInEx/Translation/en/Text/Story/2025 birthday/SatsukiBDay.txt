Satsuki Ootomi Birthday

おぅ、ダチ公。\n急に呼びだしやがって、どうしたぃ。=Ah, my buddy. What's the big idea calling me out here all of a sudden?
景色ィ？\n……まァ、こう高ぇと見晴らしはいいな。\n空っ風が冷てぇが、そろそろ吹き収めだ。邪険にするほどじゃねぇや。=The view? ...Well, yeah, can't deny it. Up this high, the sightlines are damn good. The sky wind's biting cold, but it's about time it dies down. Not harsh enough to complain about.
……あァ。\n冥の病院通ってたのも、こんな季節だったっけ。\n今よか短ぇ足で、えっちらおっちら……=...Yeah. Come to think of it, I visited Mei at the hospital during this time of the year. Had shorter legs back then. Plodding along, step by step...
……いや、なんでもねぇ。\n昔の話だ。忘れてくんな。=...Nah. Forget it. Just old memories. Don't mind me.
てか。\nお前さん結局、今日は一体どういう風の吹き回しだぃ？=By the way... what's with you today? What kind of mood brought this on?
ああ、そういやもうそんな時期……\n……って、お前さんに誕生日なんざ教えたか？\n……まァいいか。無碍にするのも野暮ってもんだ。=Ah... right. That's also something that happens around this time of the year... ...Wait. Did I ever even tell you my birthday? ...Eh, whatever. Would be bad manners to brush it off now.
それに、景色ってのも気に入ったぜ。\n物と違って、おっ死んだ後でも有意義なとことかな。=Besides, I like this view. It's not a "thing" you can hold... but even after I'm dead, it'll be a part of "me".
あんがとよ、{playername}。\n誕生日なんざ、俺にとっちゃ曇るばっかの厄日だが……\nお前さんが運んでくれた風のお陰で、ちったぁ胸がスーッとしたぜ。=Thanks, {playername}. Birthdays are usually nothing but gloomy celebrations for me, but... The wind you carried along for my sake cleared my heart, if only a little.
おいおい。\nンな恩を売られるばっかりじゃ、\n三途の川の渡し守への六文銭まで足りなくなっちまわァ。=Hey, hey. If I keep getting myself indebted to you like this, I won't have enough spare change left for the ferryman of the departed.
ま……それこそ、乗りかかった船か。\nそんなに暇なら{playername}よ、俺の墓参りに付き合いな──=Well... I guess I should worry about the ship I'm on with you right now. If you've got that much free time, {playername}, then come visit my sister's grave with me~

刹鬼さんに、ここの景色を見てほしくて。=I wanted you to see this view, Satsuki
誕生日をお祝いしたくて。=I was hoping to celebrate your birthday
他にもできることがあるといいんだけど……=If there's something else I can do... anything...
