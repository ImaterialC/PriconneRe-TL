Tomo Mikuma's Birthday

こんな繁華街であの人と待ち合わせなんて、\n珍しいな……しかも、あの人からのお誘いなんてね。=It's unusual to be meeting him in such a busy district... and even more unusual that he was the one to invite me.
今日は私の誕生日。\nあの人は何も言わなかったけど……そういうことだよね？　=Today is my birthday. He hasn't said a word about it... but that has to be the reason, right?
ふふっ。こうして待ってる時点でうれしくて顔が緩んじゃうけど、\nそれだとまたあの人のペースに乗せられちゃうよね。\nちょっとだけ……からかっちゃおうかな。=Hehe. Just standing here waiting is enough to make me smile, but if I let that show too much, he'll pull me along at his pace again. Maybe... I should tease him a little first.
ふふ、いくらでも待つよ。\nだって今日はあなたとのバースデーデートだもん。=Hehe, I'll wait as long as I need to. After all, today's my birthday date with you.
……たくさんドキドキさせてくれるんだよね？=...You'll make my heart race a lot, won't you?
何この自信……！？\nいつもだったら、デートなんて言った時点であわあわして\n挙動不審になるはずなのに……！　=What's with his confidence...!? Normally, the moment I mentioned a date, he would panic and start acting suspiciously...!
えっ？　腕を……！？　そんなの周りから見たら完全に……！\nしかも「まずは」って、それ以上があるの……！？=Huh? Linking arms...?! If people saw us like this, it'd be completely...! And "first", you said, there's more after this...?!
どうしよう、今日のこの人は一味違う……！\n私がたくさんドキドキさせて～とか言っちゃったから！？\nちょっとからかったつもりなのに本気になっちゃってる……！　=What should I do? He's acting so differently today...! Is it because I told him to make my heart race? I was only teasing him, but he's taking it seriously...!
待って待って！\nちょっと憧れるけどこんな街中でされたらドキドキしすぎちゃうから！\nもうっ、あなたは加減を知らないんだから……！=Wait, wait! I might like the idea, but if you do that here in the middle of the city, my heart's going to explode! Geez, you really don't know when to hold back...!
私の誕生日に全力を注いでくれるのはすっごくうれしいから、\nもう少しだけ段階を踏んでいこう？\nお姫様抱っこ……誰もいないところでなら、やってほしいかも。=I'm really happy you're putting so much effort into my birthday, but... let's take things one step at a time, okay? I'd like to accept that princess carry... as long as it's somewhere private.
