Princess Yui 3*
たとえこの先に、何があっても…\n騎士クンを、みんなを守りたいの\nわたしの、全てをかけて！\nこの思いは…誰にも負けない！　=No matter what happens in the future...I want to protect Kishi-kun and everyone else. I'll put everything on the line for this! This feeling...can't be defeated by anyone!
これだけの大きな魔力、\n本当に使いこなせるのかな…\n…ううん、わたしはもう迷わない\nこの瞬間に、全力を出し切る！=I wonder if I can really control such a huge amount of magic... No, I won't hesitate anymore. I'll give it my all in this moment!
戦うのは、わたしにまかせて！\n今の幸せも、未来の幸せも\n壊させたりしないよ…！\n今度こそ！　必ず！=Leave the fighting to me! I won't let anyone destroy the happiness of the present or the future! This time, for sure! Absolutely!
騎士クンのあったかい力\n前よりもすごく強くなってる…\nわたしの気持ちも、同じだよ\n騎士クンの気持ちは…どう？=The warm power of Kishi-kun has become even stronger than before... and my feelings are the same way. How about your feelings, Kishi-kun?
戦いや普段の時だけじゃなくて\nもっと色んな時間を騎士クンと\nずっっと一緒に過ごしたい…\n…まずは、食事に誘わなくちゃ！=I want to spend more time with Kishi-kun, not just in battles and regular times, but all kinds of moments... First, I have to invite him to a meal!

騎士クンと二人でパワーアップ…\nううぅ～…すごくうれしくて、\n胸の奥の気持ちが溢れ出そう\nこれも力の影響なのかな…=Powering up with Kishi-kun...Ugh~...I feel so happy, the feelings in my heart are overflowing...I wonder if this is also an effect of the power...
チェンジ・プリンセスフォーム…\nあれ！？　変身しちゃってる！？\n騎士クン！　今のはちょっと、\n言ってみたかっただけで…！=Change・Princess Form... Huh!? I've transformed?! Kishi-kun! That was just something I wanted to say...!
変身したらお腹が減るけど\n何かを頑張った後のごはんって\n美味しいから、楽しみだよね\n今日は何を食べようかな…♪=When I transform, I get hungry, but meals after working hard on something are always delicious and something to look forward to, right? I wonder what we should eat today... ♪
この力を使ってる時、騎士クンの\n格好は変わらないんだね…\nその…わたしがプリンセスなら\n王子様みたいに…なんでもない！=It seems that when using this power, Kishi-kun's appearance doesn't change. If I were a princess, I would want you to look like a prince... It's nothing!
騎士クンのためなら、わたしは\nどんなことが起きても平気だよ\n騎士クンと一緒にいられて、\n騎士クンが笑顔でいてくれたら…=I'm willing to do whatever it takes for the sake of Kishi-kun, as long as I can be with him and keep him smiling...
