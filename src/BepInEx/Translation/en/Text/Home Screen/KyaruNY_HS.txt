着物が似合ってる？いちいち言わなくていいわよ！けど、見る目あるじゃないふふん。いい気分だわ♪=I look good in a kimono? You don't have to tell me every little thing! But you've got a good eye for things. Fufu~. I'm in a good mood♪
おみくじ引いたんだけど、待ち人はすぐそばに、だってまさかあんたのこと…？あ、あっちいきなさい！=I drew a fortune slip, it says the person I'm waiting for is right next to me. Is she talking about you...? Ah, s-stay away!
なに？　あたしと羽根つきで勝負したいの？手加減しないからね！墨まみれにしてあげるわ！=What? Do you want to have an hanetsuki match with me? I won't hold back! I'll get you covered in ink!
あけましておめでとうまぁ今年もよろしくねまた騒がしい一年になりそうだけど…=Happy New Year!. Well, I wish you all the best this year. But looks like it's going to be another noisy year...
みんな年の始めから元気ねあたしは家で静かに過ごしたい…い、いや、別にあんたと居るのが嫌ってワケじゃないから！=Everyone's so energetic right from the start of the year. I'd rather be at home in peace and quiet... N-No, it's not like I don't want to be with you!

すごく静かね…まさか道間違えてないわよね？　まぁ、のんびり行くのも悪くないかもね。二人でゆっくり歩きましょ=It's so quiet here... Don't tell me we've taken the wrong path? Well, it might not be a bad idea to take it easy. Let's walk slowly together.
せっかくだからいろいろ願い事したいわよね。あんたは何を願うの？　あたしのこと？ふ、ふーん。そ、そう…=While we're here, I'd like to make a lot of wishes. What do you wish for? It's about me? I-I see, is-is that so...
夜の参道ってのも悪くないわね一緒なら怖くないし…って！暗いの平気だから！勘違いしないでよね！=It's not a bad idea to walk the path at night. As long as we're together, I'm not scared of the dark! Don't get me wrong!
ほら、行くわよ疲れたっていうなら手繋いでやっても…て、本当に繋ぐ気？　べ、別にいいけど…=Come on, let's go. We can hold hands if you're tired... W-wait do you really want to hold hands? I-I don't really mind...
神殿にお参りするだけなのに特別な気がするのは着物のおかげ？　それとも…あんたと一緒だから？=Is it the kimono that makes me feel special even though I'm just visiting the temple? Or is it because... I am with you?
