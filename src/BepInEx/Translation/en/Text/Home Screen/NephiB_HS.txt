此度は騎士殿の格別なる日お前さまらの習はしに従ひて寿ぎの詞を贈らせてくだしゃんせ『はっぴーばーすでー』…♪=On this most special day for you, Sir Knight, allow me to offer words of celebration in accordance with your customs—“Happy Birthday”…♪
騎士殿や、此度の装い御覧じて如何に思し召すや？たまさかに異彩なる有様も興あるものでありんしょう？=Sir Knight, what think you of this attire of mine today? Even an unusual appearance, worn but rarely, carries its own charm, does it not?
民草の意を統べるは言の葉ほどに易きは非ず稚児らの信じ奉る心延え無碍には致すまじく候=To govern the will of the people is not so simple as words alone; the faith entrusted by the young must never be treated lightly.
わっちにとりて姿形は些事なれど、モネなどは些か心安からざる様子その様も愛らしゅうものですが喃=Though outward form means little to me, Moné seems somewhat uneasy about it—yet even that is rather endearing.
此の身は不変の泥濘なれど世は儚く、移ろひゆく物願わくば泡沫の世の変はり騎士殿と愛でまほしく思いまする=This body may remain unchanged like stagnant mire, yet the world is fleeting and ever-shifting; I would wish to witness these transient changes together with you, Sir Knight.
姿のみならず。わっちの胸中にも変転の兆しありけり。其れも皆騎士殿の御座しませばこそ実にも罪作りなる御方です喃=Not only appearances—there are signs of change within my own heart as well. Such things come to pass only because of your presence; truly, you are a sinful one indeed.
巷には『さぷらいず』なる戯れがあると聞き侍り騎士殿の生誕を祝う贈り物、匣に収めたわっちなどいかがかえ=I have heard of a diversion called a “surprise.” As a gift to celebrate your birth, how would it be if I myself were placed inside a box?
移ろいて闇路を進み行き、光明を信じて揺るがず不退転たる我が矜持にて百鬼千妖万魔を束ね導かん=As the world shifts and we tread dark paths, I shall gather and guide countless spirits and demons alike with unwavering resolve, believing in the light.
眼を、心を民草と交え、偽りなく相対す而して初めて悟りに至ることもあり申す=Only by meeting the people eye to eye and heart to heart, without falsehood, may true understanding finally be attained.
鬼神が如き猛き力に、仏が如き静寂なる心清濁共に呑み込みてこそ拓き得る道もありんしょう=With strength fierce as a demon and a mind serene as a Buddha, embracing both purity and impurity alike—thus may new paths be opened.
お前さまの真心こそが真に皆人を救い給ふ度に然る道筋もあるものかと驚嘆するばかりにて候=Each time your sincere heart saves others, I can only stand in awe that such a path truly exists.
騎士殿と共にあらば我が内に燃ゆる煉火、豈絶ゆる時は参り来ませぬ=So long as I stand beside you, Sir Knight, the purgatorial flame within me shall never fade.

稚児らが歩みを重ねて日々育ちゆくが如く\nわっちもまた想いを重ね\nお前さまらと共に生ひ成りましょうぞ\n=Just as children grow day by day with each step they take,\nso too shall I gather my feelings\nand grow together with you all.
食の趣向の程、僭越ながら拝聞致したく候\nわっち手づから、美味なる膳を整えて進ぜましょうぞ\nあわよくば騎士殿の胃袋、掌に収めたく存じ候…♪\n=If I may be so bold, I would wish to hear your tastes in food.\nWith my own hands I shall prepare a splendid feast for you.\nAnd perhaps… I might even capture your stomach within my palm…♪
わっちもまたお前さまが択びし路に\n信を置き身を委ねましょうや\n相共に、艱難辛苦を乗り越え行かんがために\n=I too shall place my trust in the path you have chosen,\nentrusting myself to it,\nso that together we may overcome every hardship.
然れど我が心はもはや憂くこともなし\nお前さまらの択び取りし路が\n今この刻につきて結ばれたればこそ…\n=Yet my heart knows no sorrow now,\nfor the path you have chosen\nhas been bound together at this very moment.
これよりお前さまらを待ち受くるは\n誠に酷なる運命でありんしょう\n苦しき選択を迫られるやもしれませぬ\n=What awaits you from here on shall surely be a cruel fate,\nand you may be forced to make painful choices.
此の身は煉獄に生くる民草の総意\n其の志の高さに見合うて、装いも絢爛に遂げて候\nフフ…御手で触れ、確かめてみますかえ？\n=This body embodies the collective will of those who live in purgatory.\nIn accordance with that lofty resolve, even my attire has grown splendid.\nHehe… would you care to confirm it with your own hands?
外より来る禍、極間近に迫りけり\n前代未聞の難事が、前途に憚るやもしれませぬ\nわっちの隣に居らぬ折は、努々油断なさりませぬよう\n=Calamities from beyond draw ever closer.\nUnprecedented trials may stand before you.\nWhen you are not at my side, pray do not let your guard down.
此の『ひとでなし』の胸すら満たす、温かき火\n煉獄の数多の熱は知れど、此の熱は騎士殿なればこそ\nより近しく、お前さまを感じ入ることが叶いまして候\n=Even this inhuman chest is filled by a warm flame.\nThough I know many fires of purgatory, only this warmth—because it is you, Sir Knight—allows me to feel you so closely.
流転する万物の裡に、変わらざるものが確と在らば\n喩え人擬きの身の程に余ろうとも、\nお前さまとの不変なる絆、結ばせてくだしゃんせ\n=If within all that endlessly changes there exists something unchanging,\nthen even one such as I, unworthy though I may be,\nwishes to forge an eternal bond with you.
然れども騎士殿や\nお前さまらと縁を繋ぎ、わっちも皆の傍に在りたいと\n心の真より思い定むるようになりんした\n=And yet, Sir Knight,\nthrough the bonds I share with you all,\nI have come to truly wish from my heart to remain by everyone’s side.
世は移ろい行くもの\nわっちは只、掌に包むが如く其れらを護り、\n危難より遠ざけるが使命と思い侍り\n=The world is ever-changing.\nMy duty, I believe, is to protect it as though cradled within my palms,\nand keep it safe from calamity.
