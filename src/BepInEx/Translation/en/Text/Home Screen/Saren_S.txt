あははっ\n日が暮れるまで浜辺でゆっくり…\nこんな日があってもいいわよね=Ahaha, it's nice to have a day to relax on the beach until the sun sets, isn't it?
貝殻を集めてアクセサリー作り\nなんてのも悪くないわね\n思い出作りよ？　売ろうなんて\n考えてないわよ？　たぶんね=Collecting seashells and making accessories isn't a bad idea for making memories, is it? I'm not thinking of selling them or anything, you know? probably.

子どもたちと賑やかに\n過ごすのはもちろん楽しいけど\nあんたと二人きりで過ごすのも\nなかなかいいわね=Of course it's fun to spend time with the children and have a lively atmosphere, but spending time alone with you is also quite nice.

海に来るのなんて久しぶりね～\nせっかくのバカンスなんだから\n楽しまなきゃ損よ！=It's been a long time since I've been to the beach~ Since it's a precious vacation, I have to enjoy it or it'll be a waste!
本当にきれいな海よね\nもし誰もいない浜辺であんたと\n二人っきりだったら…って！\nなんであたしそんなことを！=The sea is really beautiful, isn't it? If we were alone on a deserted beach, just the two of us... Wait! Why am I saying such a thing!
捕まえてみなさ～い♪\nな、なんてことあたしが\nできるわけないじゃない！！=Try to catch me~♪ W-wait, there's no way I could do something like that!!
