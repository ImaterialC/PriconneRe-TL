陽射しが強くなってきたな…あっちで涼みながらかき氷でも食べるのはどう？…決まりだね。行こうか！=The sun is getting pretty strong... How about we cool off with some shaved ice over there? ...It's decided. Let's go!
右を見ても左を見てもカップルばかりだけど…みんなの目に、私たちは…どう…映っているのかな…？=Whether you look left or right, there are couples everywhere... I wonder what people think when they see us...?
時間がどれだけあっても足りなく感じてしまうねキミとこんな日々をずっと…そう夢見るくらいは許されるかな=No matter how much time we have, it never feels like enough. I wonder if it's okay to dream about being with you like this forever...
こうして広がる海を見ていると晴れやかな気分になるよ足取りまで軽くなるみたいで…そうだ、向こうまで競争しない？=Looking out at the open sea makes me feel so refreshed. It even lightens my steps... Hey, want to race to that spot over there?
潮風が気持ちいいねこんなに穏やかな時間はいつぶりだろう…キミもこっちで一緒に海を眺めようよ=The sea breeze feels so nice. It's been a while since I've had such a peaceful time... Come over here and watch the ocean with me.
青い海に照り付ける太陽…これぞバカンスって感じだね楽しむ準備はできてる？夏は待ってくれないよ！=The blue sea and the blazing sun... Now this is what a vacation feels like. Are you ready to have fun? Summer doesn't wait!
冷たくて気持ちいいね…せっかくの水着なんだから海に入らないともったいないよ？ほら、キミもこっちにおいで！=It's so cool and refreshing... Since we're in our swimsuits, it'd be a waste not to get into the water, right? Come on, join me!
ここの生き物はあまり人を警戒しないのかなこんなに近くでも逃げないで…ふふっ、小さくてかわいいね=The creatures here don't seem too afraid of people. Even this close, they don't run away... Hehe, they're so tiny and cute.
この空に羽ばたく海鳥のようにいつか私も…限りのない自由を掴み取ってみせる=Like the seabirds flying in the sky, I want to grasp endless freedom one day.
ずっと胸がドキドキしてどうにも抑えきれないんだ…夏の雰囲気に私も当てられたのかな…？=My heart keeps racing, and I can't seem to calm down... Could it be the summer atmosphere that's affecting me...?
