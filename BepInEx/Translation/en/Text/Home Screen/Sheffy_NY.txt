New Year Sheffy 3*
おせち料理…食べすぎちゃった…\n…でも。食べないで後悔するより\n食べて後悔する日があっても\nいいわよね…♪=Osechi ryori...I ate too much ...... but it's ok to have a day when you regret eating it rather than not eating it. Even if there are days when I regret eating too much, it's okay...♪
『今の私』にとって\n正月を過ごすのは初めてだから\nあなたの行きたい場所があれば\n私も一緒に連れて行ってくれる？=This is my first time spending the New Year's holiday as "my current self", so if there's a place you want to go, would you take me with you?
正月ってすごいわね…\nまるでお祭りみたい…\nええと…迷子にならないように\n裾…掴んでてもいいかしら…？=The New Year's holiday is amazing...it's just like a festival...eeto, would it be okay if I hold onto your sleeve so I don't get lost...?
あなたはお参りで何を願ったの？\n私は…『今の私』にとって\n大切にしたいことを…\n絶対…叶えてみせるわ=What did you wish for when you visited the shrine? For me, I wished for the things that are important to "my current self"...I'll definitely make them come true.
待たせてごめんなさい\n着付けに時間がかかっちゃって…\n…え？　似合ってる？\nあ、ありがとう…=I'm sorry for making you wait. It took me some time to put on my kimono...Eh? Do I look good? T-thank you...

New Year Sheffy 1*
ど、どうかしら…？\nコッコロさんと一緒に選んだの…\n着付けも慣れてないし…\nその…変なところはない…？=I don't know...I chose this dress with Kokkoro-san...I'm not used to dressing like this...so...is there anything weird about it...?
『記念に写真を撮ろう』って…\nイ、イヤじゃないけど\n私一人だけじゃなくて…\nあなたとも一緒に撮りたいわ=When you say 'let's take a picture to remember this', I don't mind, but I don't just want to take a picture alone...I want to take a picture with you too.
【美食殿】の一員として\n正月の名物料理は\n全て堪能してみせるわ\n魔物の肉でも…が、がんばる…=As a member of the Gourmet Guild, I'll be able to enjoy all of the New Year's specialties, even monster meat... but I'll do my best...
せっかくの正月だものね\n私もたまには息抜きして\nあなたと新年の思い出を\n作ろうと思うわ=It's a special New Year's holiday after all, so I think I'll take a break once in a while and create some New Year's memories with you.
…ん。絶好のお参り日和ね\nさぁ、早く行きましょう\nあなたと過ごす貴重な\n休日を無駄にしたくないもの=...mh. It's the perfect weather for visiting the shrine. Let's go quickly. I don't want to waste this precious holiday spent with you.
